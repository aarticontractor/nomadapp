# NomadApp

## Description

The NomadApp is a web application designed to provide users with information about a city, including details about the city's history and current weather conditions. The app uses the Wikipedia API to fetch city information and the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.

As web developers, working on the NomadApp challenged us to create an interactive front-end application that showcases our collaborative skills and coding abilities. This project demonstrates our understanding of key web development technologies and the ability to work with server-side APIs and JSON data.

In addition to building a functional NomadApplication, this project helped us develop problem-solving skills and the ability to work with client-side technologies. Overall, completing the NomadApp was an important step in our development as web developers and prepared us for future web development challenges.

## Project Requirements

- Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
- Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
- Be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input).
- Use at least two server-side APIs.
- Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
- Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
- Be responsive.
- Have a polished UI.
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id-naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
- Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Functionality

NomadApp allows users to:

- Search for a city and view relevant information about that city.
- View current weather conditions in the searched city.
- Interact with a responsive and polished UI.
- Store recent searches for easy access.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (Tailwind CSS framework)
- JavaScript
- Wikipedia API
- OpenWeatherMap API

## Acknowledgements

This project was completed as part of a web coding project for a web development course. We utilized the Wikipedia API to retrieve city information and the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data.

## Getting Started

To get started with NomadApp, simply open the link at the bottom of the readme. Enter a city name in the search bar and click the search button to retrieve information and weather data about that city. The search results will be displayed, along with a list of recent searches for easy access.
