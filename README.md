# Interactive Front-End Project: NomadApp

## Description

NomadApp is a travel and tourism tool designed to help users explore new destinations. The application allows users to search for a city and view relevant information and images about notable places in that area. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and utilizes the Foursquare API to fetch location information and images.

As web developers, working on NomadApp challenged us to create an interactive front-end application that showcases our collaborative skills and coding abilities. This project demonstrates our understanding of key web development technologies and the ability to work with server-side APIs and JSON data.

In addition to building a functional travel application, this project helped us develop problem-solving skills and the ability to work with client-side technologies. Overall, completing the Interactive Front-End Project: NomadApp was an important step in our development as web developers and prepared us for future web development challenges.

## Project Requirements

- Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
- Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
- Be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input).
- Use at least two server-side APIs.
- Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
- Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
- Be responsive.
- Have a polished UI.
- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id-naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
- Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

## Functionality

NomadApp allows users to:

- Search for a city and view relevant information about notable places in that area.
- Access images of the selected places.
- Interact with a responsive and polished UI.
- Store recent searches for easy access.

- Foursquare API

## Acknowledgements

This project was completed as part of an Interactive Front-End Project, with the instructions provided by our teacher. We utilized the Foursquare API to retrieve location information and images.

## Getting Started

To get started with NomadApp, simply open the link at the bottom of the readme. Enter a city name in the search bar and click the search button to retrieve information and images about notable places in that area. The search results will be displayed, along with a list of recent searches for easy access.
